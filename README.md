# ⚡ Cloudforce (Formerly CloudForce NOW) ⚡
-------------------------------------------

⚠️ THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT - EXPECTED RELEASE: 2025 ⚠️

Cloudforce is a portable application launcher designed to run games and applications on restricted machines without administrative privileges or on USB drives. It supports custom app sources following the format specified in our [Custom Source Guide](CUSTOM_SOURCE_GUIDE.md).

-------------------------------------------

## 📖 History

Cloudforce started as a tool to expand GeForce NOW's capabilities by enabling users to run both games and regular applications through the cloud gaming service. It provided a central hub for downloading and launching applications beyond gaming.

Due to the original domain being shut down, the application stopped working. This led to a complete rebuild focused on making it work universally on any computer without administrator access, whether for cloud gaming or local portable applications.
