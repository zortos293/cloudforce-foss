## 📖 History

Cloudforce started as a tool to expand GeForce NOW's capabilities by enabling users to run both games and regular applications through the cloud gaming service. It provided a central hub for downloading and launching applications beyond gaming.

Due to the original domain being shut down, the application stopped working. This led to a complete rebuild focused on making it work universally on any computer without administrator access, whether for cloud gaming or local portable applications.
